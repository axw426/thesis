\chapter{Top Tagging}

Generic top tagger, explain overall approach of using 6 BDTs

Overall analysis method

If we end up with cut on the energy, start with full energy range analysis to highlight problems

Explain it will be tested in terms of AFB. 
Explain importance of AFB measurement

\section{lepton finding}
Method- based on using Pandora ID and jet isolation

Lepton finding efficiency
Asymmetry
Gamma correction for electrons
Charge tagging efficiency
QbyP

\section{jet finding}
Concept of fat jets
reconstruction efficiency in terms of theta
Compare alogrithms in terms of top mass and angle for reconstruction
Compare methods picking the correct 

\subsection{fat jet properties}
Multiplicity- systematic uncertainty
Angular relations
nSubjettiness

\section{ISR effects}
Photon energy vs angle
Inability to reconstruct leptonic top
Boost introduced to $t\bar{t}$ system
Imact on reconstrcuted angle

\section{event selection}
No need to re-explain BDTs but should explain why and how we use 6 bdts
Final selection results for a particular working point

\section{AFB determination}

Methods for calculating it and variation between them-
Effect of ISR
Effect of BDT selection
Background modelling

Potentially adding cuts on acceptance- need to add in extrapolation??
