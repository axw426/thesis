\chapter{DECALStudies}
\label{sect:DECAL}
General concept- energy proportional to nParticles

Explain potential benefits- cheape, same tech as inner detectors, granularity could improve particle flow


Description of Mokka \& Geant4

Detector changes implemented for simulations- smaller pixel size, active silicon replaced with thinner active silicon layer and passive silicon layer
 

\section{DigiMAPs}
Various effects on resolution
Charge Spread
Background Noise
Signal Noise
Clustering
Threshold

\section{Design Optimization}
Aspect Ratio for resolution
Linearity
Leakage= do studies based on change in radiator- tungsten vs lead


\section{Hardware studies}
Assuming this ever works....
