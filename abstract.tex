\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
%
Within the next few years a decision must be made by the global community on what type of high energy colliders should be built in the post LHC era. Here we present studies showing what might be achieved if a linear lepton collider such as \ac{CLIC} is chosen. Two physics studies are presented showing the precision achievable in the electroweak sector when operating at 1.4 TeV. Firsty the measurement of $\sigma_{H\nu\bar{\nu}} \times BR(H\rightarrow WW^*)$, an integral component for model independent Higgs measurements, is described using the semileptonic decay channel and is shown to yield a statistical precision of 1.3\% for 1.5 ab$^{-1}$ of data. A differential measurement of the top quark forward backward asymmetry is also performed as a probe of the electroweak form factors of the ttX vertex yielding a statistical precision of $\mathcal{O}$(1\%) for 1.5 ab$^{-1}$ of data. Lastly, the potential for using a novel design of a \ac{DECAL} at the \ac{ILC} is studied showing that an energy resolution of $\frac{\sigma_E}{E}=\frac{16.1\%}{\sqrt{E}} \oplus \frac{0.5\%}{E} \oplus 0.4\%$ can be achieved, similar to what is seen for the standard design choice, when using 30 $\mu m$ pitch pixels with a 12 $\mu m$ epitaxial thickness.
