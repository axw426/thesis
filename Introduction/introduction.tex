\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

Following the discovery of the Higgs, there is no clear direction in which high erngy physics should proceed. Many reasons to continue searches- hierarchy problem, dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry- but few bounds on the energy scale required to see them. Two main ways for experiments to proceed- push the energy frontier to search for high mass particles, push the precision frontier to find small deviations from the standard model or hard to detect processes. For high energy physics use hadron collider, precision use lepton. Explain benefits of both types. Both types being pursued- FCC and ILC/CLIC, described in chapter xx. Here we will focus on the later.
